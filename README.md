# Arduino Receiver Cooling
Cooling system + LED visualizer for receiver controlled by an Arduino Uno.

The Arduino Uno uses temperature sensors to actively monitor the ambient temperature of an home cinema receiver. 
The data is examined and, if within set thresholds, the fans are activated at an appropriate speed. As the temperature increases,
the speed of the fans are also increased.

A connected LED strip indicates the current state of the system as well as the ambient temperature by the use of colour.
